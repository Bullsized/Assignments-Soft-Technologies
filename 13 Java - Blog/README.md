JAVA: BLOG BASIC FUNCTIONALITY

The blog is ready to be presented as a homework. Most used folders:

\src\main\java\softuniBlog\controller

\src\main\java\softuniBlog\entity

\src\main\resources\templates

Some of the HTML tags were renamed and the files created by me with IntelliJ start with comments.
The additional Word files are for setting up the blog and how to run it with MySQL and HeidiSQL database.

Enjoy.
