EXAM PREPARATION I - TODO LIST

01 PHP - added just the \src\AppBundle folder, I've worked only on those php files. Otherwise - read the Word file for further instructions (Doctrine, MySQL, Heidi and so on) and use the Skeletons from SoftUni.

02 JavaScript - added just the \models and the \controllers folders. Same applies here - you need mongoDB and Robomongo.

03 Java - added just the \src\main\java\todolist folders. Need to import the project with IntelliJ, otherwise it refuses to start.

04 C# - added just the \Models and \Controllers folders. Everything you can get from the skeleton and Visual Studio will download the rest.

Enjoy.
