EXAM 2017-09-02 SHOPPING LIST

All of the projects are up, feel free to take a look at the exam. PHP was a bit wanky with the usings, that was one of my issues, also in JavaScript one of the views had to be changed (the foreach loop in the index file). I'm also attaching the skeletons (the .rar file), as well as the Word file with the instructions. 

Enjoy.
