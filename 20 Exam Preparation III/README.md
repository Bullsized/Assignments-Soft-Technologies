EXAM PREPARATION III - IMDB

01 PHP - this time I've decided to add the whole project, without the \var, \vendor and the .idea folder (PhpStorm will take care of some of that). Need to run the composer.phar, have XAMPP start all the servers and use HeidiSQL for the database.

02 JavaScript - this time I've decided to add the whole project, without the node_folder and the .idea folder, which will be automatically downloaded for you by WebStorm. You need to run the "start-mongodb.bat" then deal with the database with Robo3T.

03 Java - this time I've decided to add the whole project, without the .idea folder. IntelliJ will compile everything else for you. A simple portable HeidiSQL should do the trick for the database.

04 C# - this time I've decided to add the whole project, without the \bin and the \obj folders. The rest is obtainable from the Skeleton and Visual Studio. You can handle the database with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17. Had a few issues with the Skeleton, but was able to fix it with the help of this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15873126/unable-to-launch-the-iis-express-web-server - I was getting some annoying error "Unable to launch IIS express web server", but I fixed it, so now it's working.

As usual, the Word file contains the-what-to and the-how-to. Enjoy and see you in the next repo ;)
