EXAM PREPARATION II - KANBAN BOARD

01 PHP -  this time I've decided to add the whole project, without the \var, \vendor and the idea folder (PhpStorm will take care of some of that). Need to run the composer.phar, have XAMPP start all the servers and use HeidiSQL for the database. 

02 JavaScript - this time I've decided to add the whole project, without the node_folder, which will be automatically downloaded for you from WebStorm. Adjusted the project to start with Node.JS, changed the contollers and models, couple of new solutions added. You need to run the "start-mongodb.bat" then deal with the database with Robo3T.

03 Java - this time I've decided to add the whole project, without the .idea folder. IntelliJ will compile everything else for you. A simple portable HeidiSQL should do the trick for the database.

04 C# - this time I've decided to add the whole project, without the \bin and the \obj folders. The rest is obtainable from the Skeleton and Visual Studio. You can handle the database with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17.

As usual, the Word file contains the-what-to and the-how-to. Enjoy.
