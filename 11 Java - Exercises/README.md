All the solutions are in folder "src\com\company". They've all been made into separate classes. 

The last few tasks incorporate a class-into-class files, which is wrong, but it's made that way for the sake of the Judge system.

The names of the tasks start with "e" and then the number, since IntelliJ will not save a "01 Task Name" type of naming.
